# Mission Types: "Break" & "Place" & "Hunter" & "Murderer"
# Add more jobs in this format:
# Job-Name: (can contain a-z, A-Z, 0-9 & -)(don't use 0-9 or - at the first of the Job's name)
#   Button-Name: "§fYour Job Button Name"
#   Image-Type: 0
#   Image: "textures/blocks/diamond_block"

#   Mission:
#     BlockID:BlockData:MissionType: Money (if you want Break or Place JobType)
#     MissionType: Money (if you want Hunter or Murderer JobType)
#     e.g.

#     2:0:Place: 10 (By Placing Grass you will earn 10$)

#     Murderer: 30 (By Killing Players you will earn 30$)
#
# NOTE: Even you can add more than 1 MissionType for each Job. So that you will have a Mixed Job.
# For example a combination of a Break and Murderer MissionType ;)
#
# NOTES FOR CHANGING THE UI DETAILS: (Button-Name & Image-Type & Image)
# Use "§" and "0-9" or "a-f" and "r" after it to add a color. E.g. "§6This text will be Orange"
# Use "\n" to go to the next line. E.g. "First Line\nSecond Line"
# Image Types: 0 (Path like "textures/blocks/coal_ore") and 1 (URL like "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/minecraft_gamepedia/c/c5/Oak_Log_Axis_Y_JE5_BE3.png")
# URL Image Type starts with "https://"
# If you don't want an image for the button, put the Image Type to: -1
# NOTE: Path Image Type loads faster
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: if you don't follow the right format for jobs, your server might crash.
